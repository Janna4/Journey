# Journey
Journey is a story based game where the player makes decisions along the way in an
attempt to find a friend who went missing. Throughout the game, the user will be able to pick up items and hold them in an inventory. The user will be able to view the items during any scene that allows the user to make a choice. The game will start off with a simple start screen that has the user push the up arrow to start the game. Once the user starts the game, the game will tell the user how to play and the backstory. After this, the story begins.

The player will start by looking at a scene by a river with a mountain in the background.
Here the user will be presented with a choice. They can either cross the river by floating across on a log or by crossing a rotten looking tree. If they go across the river by floating, they will have a 75% failure chance. If they go across by using the tree as a bridge, they will have a 50% failure chance. If the user fails, they will be brought back to the scene where they can make their choice. If the user succeeds, they will move on to the next scene.

In the next scene, the user will pick how they get up the mountain. They can try a short,
steeper route where they’ll have a 15% chance to slide back to the base of the mountain due to this path's steepness. If the user makes it up this path, a victory scene will be displayed where the user is reunited with their friend. 

The other path up the mountain is much longer. When taking this path, night will come
upon the user. The user will then have to decide where to sleep. They can either sleep out in the open or in a dark cave. If the user tries to sleep out in the open, there will be a 50% chance that the user doesn’t survive the night due to hazardous weather. If the user dies, they will receive an explanation for their death. If the user survives, a victory scene will be displayed where the user is reunited with their friend. 

If the user decides to sleep in the cave, they will find a dragon. This dragon will give
them a riddle. If the user gets the riddle right, the dragon flies the user to the friend. A victory scene is then displayed where the dragon, the user, and the friend are all united. If the user gets the riddle wrong, the dragon leaves the cave for the night and the user sleeps in the cave. After the night, the user will have the option to give up on the journey. If the user gives up, an end scene will be shown where the user is congratulated for their efforts. If the user continues, a victory scene will be displayed where the user is reunited with their friend.
